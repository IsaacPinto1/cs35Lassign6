Added a 'check' target to the makefile. I first set a const 'SIZE', and then run randall on that
SIZE, and check that the output length is the same as SIZE. I counted the output using 'wc -c'

Then I started to separate files

I started with options, moving the first chunk of logic
to options.c. I made options.c return nbytes, and if it was
invalid it returns -1.

I made sure to add include guards to the .h file as well.

I then tested that this separation of options worked with
make check, which it did, so I continued to separate the
rand64-hw functions.

Along the way, I modified the make file to have $^, and
added options.c and rand64-hw.c to the prerequisite list

I continued to separate the software and output files, and
my 'make check' ran successfully.
